	<h1> Personal Information </h1>
		<br>

	<p> I am 30 years old and was born in Australia. I am Caucasian and Indigenous Australian, and I only speak English.
	I dropped out of school back in 2006 and worked as an apprentice Motorcycle Mechanic for a couple of years before enlisting in the 
	Australian Army as an Advanced Medical Technician at 21 years old. During my time in the Army, I received my Diploma in Nursing and Diploma 
	in Paramedical Science as well as a few other Certificate III’s related to the medical research field. I went on to study 
	my Bachelor of Nursing, which I was unable to continue in the last semester due to medical reasons related to my service. After I 
	returned to functional health, I completed my Certificate IV in Business Management and my Certificate IV in Security Management. 
	I love spending time with my small family, my wife Tanya and daughter Katara. We enjoy doing all our hobbies together. I enjoy living
	an active lifestyle, every weekday I wake up to a morning run and after work hours twice a week we either go skating, cycling, or 
	hiking as a family. I also really enjoy food so must constantly balance these two pastimes.
	My other hobbies include online gaming on PC or console, mechanical diagnosis, and repair, and reading fantasy novels. My favourite 
	books are the ones that started my reading passion which include Deltora’s Quest and Magician. Raymond E.Feist is one of my favourite authors 
	alongside J.R.R.Tolkien and Brandon Sanderson.
