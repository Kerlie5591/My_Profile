	<p> A leading software development company, IT Magnet, is looking for an experienced software developer 
	to join their team. They are requesting a developer for a system that is used nationwide by many users for 
	end-to-end business processes where the highest priority is security. Some of the responsibilities of the 
	developer will be to design and develop software, write, and maintain programming code, and test, troubleshoot 
	and debug errors in programming language. 
	This position appeals to me as I love the idea of working for an experienced, innovative company that develops 
	custom software to suit the needs of their clients which range from small businesses to large organisations. 
	I feel that a position like this would be both challenging and rewarding, with projects differing enough to 
	constantly pique my interest and develop my skills.
	</p>
	<br>

	<p> Essential skills required for the position include knowledge of C# programming language, advanced MS SQL, a 
	minimum of a bachelor’s degree in IT, excellent communication, cloud computing concept, and over four years’ 
	experience in the field. I don’t currently have any qualifications they require; however, I have a lot of 
	working experience, a passion for the industry and field, and other desirable skills. These skills include 
	great communication, strong time management and attention to detail, excellent customer service, great teamwork 
	and team building, strong multi-tasking ability and organisational skills, I am culturally appropriate and 
	un-biased, resilient, highly reliable, I have great problem-solving skills and am very resourceful. 
	Working towards being suited for a position like this, I plan to complete and attain a Bachelor of Information 
	Technology to improve my knowledge as much as possible and undergo many short courses in C# programming language 
	and MS SQL until I feel confident in my abilities. Then I plan to find a position in software development for 
	a smaller company to build my experience and consolidate my skills.
