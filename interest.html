	<h1> My Interest in IT </h1>
	<br>

	<h3> What is your interest in IT and when did it start? Was there a particular event that sparked your interest? <br>
	Outline IT experience. </h3>		
		
	<p> I have always liked fixing or improving things. I usually did this with my hands via home improvements and such. Back in my 
	early 20’s I helped a friend fix their computer after it obtained a virus and found the challenge to be rewarding and fulfilling. 
	I started learning more about IT and it became a hobby. I ended up making a basic app to help with fuel ratios for 2-stroke 
	motorbikes for my friends. I researched the IT field and noticed how many different fields there are. This appeals to me as I 
	like to continuously discover and learn new things. I have dabbled in Android app programming using JavaScript and some basic 
	webpage design with HTML and CSS.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3> Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>

	<p> I have been interested In the Information Technology (IT) field for quite a while and wanted to make sure I chose a university 
	that would give me the best possible chance of success. I researched different universities for over 4 months trying to find one 
	that would provide me with the knowledge I would need to succeed in the IT profession. After all my research I had reduced my 
	potential list to three universities but just couldn’t decide, until I seen an advert on Facebook for Open Universities Australia 
	(OUA). I got in contact with OUA, and they gave me the different options based on my criteria. After hearing RMIT is one of the best 
	universities in Australia for IT and is recognised for its leadership and innovation in technology, I knew RMIT would be my best 
	chance at success.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
		
	<p> During my studies I expect to learn as much as possible about the IT field. I expect to learn how to use a computer and other 
	technologies to create, process, store, and exchange data electronically. I hope to gain the knowledge to confidently develop 
	software through different coding languages, create webpages, and troubleshoot a variety of different issues that commonly present 
	with computers and other devices. I also want to gain knowledge and skills in ethical hacking and learn the required skills needed 
	to succeed in cyber security. Overall, I am looking forward to learning about the different IT fields and how they assist people 
	in everyday life.
