	<h1> My Project Idea </h1>
	<br>

	<h3> Overview </h3>
				
	<p> My project idea is an everyday workout smartphone app that is affordable, targeting busy parents. The app will 
	focus on time-sensitive parents that struggle with the motivation to exercise when they have a busy schedule. This 
	appeals to me because I have always enjoyed exercising and since having our first child, I have noticed that most 
	of my time is spent prioritising her needs rather than my health. This doesn’t allow for much time when I incorporate 
	working, household chores, family time, and study. I feel an app that has an effective workout routine for 10 minutes 
	or under each day will be of great benefit to parents everywhere. 
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3> Motivation </h3>
		
	<p> A current study concluded that only 17.6% of parents exercised regularly (Sukys et al. 2014), due to the commitments, 
	prioritisation, and unpredictability of parenting (Samataro 2015). This results in parents finding it difficult to create 
	and maintain a schedule, often neglecting exercise. My project offers a solution by providing a time-effective workout 
	routine with varying intensities that can include children. The features of the app will allow parents to easily slot 
	exercise into their busy days and help provide motivation. The biggest drawback I foresee is visibility, there are currently 
	similar apps, and they may not have all the same features, but they have been in the market for a while, making it harder 
	to convince people that my app will be beneficial. 
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3> Description </h3>
		
	<p> The workout app will be affordable and have a user-friendly interface. Users will be able to select to sign in/sign 
	up using their email address, google account, or other social media accounts. The app will include an options page so the 
	user can login/logout, change sound and notification settings, recover workout data, allow them to select their workout 
	intensity from beginner, easy, medium, and hard. The app will include an option to autosave their workout history to a 
	cloud-based account when they are signed in, allowing them to keep their data if something happens to the app and they 
	need to reinstall. It will also include the option to share their completed workouts on social media, if they are linked, 
	and the main page will include a forums link so the parents can chat with others that use the app. On the home screen 
	there will also be a section for users to view ‘step by step’ tutorial videos for each individual exercise included in 
	the app. There will also be a separate page for users to view their workout history stats with a bar graph so they can 
	track their progress against previous workouts. The app will also allow the user to run Spotify in the background during 
	workouts. 
	</p>
	<br>

	<p> The app will include notifications allowing users to set preferred workout times and days they would like to work out, 
	so they can be reminded to do their workouts if they become busy and forget. The notification will also include a motivational 
	quote to help the user get in the mood.
	On the workout page, the user can select from a variety of pre-set workout routines which are customisable or create their 
	own workouts. After the user selects a workout, the page changes to show them their current intensity, workout time settings 
	and to select if they are working out with a child or not. If they select to workout with a child, a new page will appear with 
	the pre-set workouts that are child friendly so the parent can select one before continuing. Once the user selects the 
	‘ready to go’ button a page will appear with a GIF image showing the exercise to perform, a timer at the top of the page showing 
	the overall workout time elapsed, a larger timer below for the time spent on the current exercise, next to that is a number 
	showing the reps to perform before continuing. At the bottom of the screen will be a ‘pause’ button and a ‘next’ button to move 
	to next exercise once required reps have been performed. When the user reaches the last exercise it will replace the ‘next’ 
	button with a ‘complete’ button, which will open a page that congratulates the user on completing the workout, which can be 
	skipped with a button at the bottom.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3> Tools and Technologies </h3>
		
	<p> To create this smartphone app, multiple tools are required. This includes a computer that can run the software required 
	to develop the app, a knowledgeable fitness professional, and an internet connection capable of decent download/upload speeds. 
	The software I will need will be an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is specifically designed to develop 
	Android apps and is compatible with both Kotlin and Java programming language, such as Android Studio, as these are the 
	only languages that I have basic knowledge in. An IDE “enables programmers to consolidate the different aspects of writing 
	a computer program” (Codecademy 2021, para. 2). 
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3> Skills Required </h3>
		
	<p> The main skills required for my project will include advanced programming skills, knowledge in Java and Kotlin 
	programming languages (Percival & Stock 2021), and an understanding of different workout routines. I will need to understand 
	how Android Studio operates and how to navigate this software. I currently have very basic knowledge with both programming 
	languages and the software required. I think it will be easy to discover courses online that teach beginners how to improve 
	their coding skills using Java and Kotlin. With a bit of extra study and lots of practice I believe attaining the skills 
	required for this project will be plausible.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3> Outcome </h3>
		
	<p> If my project is successful, busy parents will be able to use my app to help them achieve their fitness goals, whether 
	it be weight loss, being more active, or add to their current exercise routines. With the included features of my app, the 
	original problem of time limitations or motivation to become more active and start exercising, will be a thing of the past. 
	I believe the overall impact will be more active parents that are less sedentary, heathier and are happier with their body 
	image, and this in turn will promote their children to be more active.
