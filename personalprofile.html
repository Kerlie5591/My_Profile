	<h1> My Personal Profile </h1>
		<br>
	<h3> Myers-Briggs test results: </h3>
			
	<p> According to 16Personalities (2021), this test presents me as an Architect-type personality 
	(INTJ-A). This personality type has strong inclination towards logic and questioning, as shown with 
	52% thinking trait, and often prioritise rationality and success over normal social conventions, as 
	displayed in the 59% introversion result. The drive to be innovate and successful, while maintaining 
	independence, displays a willingness to be assertive (79%) while also allowing intuitive (73%) skills 
	to develop and grow. Architects are considered a contradictory personality type, described as 
	“imaginative yet decisive, ambitious yet private, and curious yet focused” (16Personalities 2021, para. 11). 
	</p>
	<br>
	
	<h3> Learning Style test results: </h3>
		
	<p> My primary learning style is Visual (39%), followed by Kinaesthetic (35%), with Auditory (26%) being 
	my least preferred learning style (Personality Max 2021). This test shows my inclination towards visual 
	learning, meaning I gain information from sight more than other methods. This includes viewing pictures, 
	surroundings and seeing written words. According to Personality Max (2021) I benefit most from teaching 
	styles that utilise charts, diagrams, videos, and illustrations. My secondary learning style means I also 
	learn from doing things through hands-on learning or physical activity (Personality Max 2021). Auditory 
	learning through hearing is my weakest learning style, meaning I sometimes miss things or fail to adequately 
	comprehend and process instructions or retain information when there are no visual cues (Personality Max 2021). 
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3> Big Five Personality test results: </h3>
		
	<p> According to Koerth and Wolfe (2019), my top scores are Openness to experience (79%), Agreeableness (71%), and 
	Conscientiousness (83%), with my lowest scores being Extraversion (63%), and Negative Emotionality (21%). What this 
	means to me is that I have a curious mind and I constantly seek new things to explore, I’m compassionate, responsible, 
	organised, and hardworking, with a strong sense of commitment and attention to detail (Koerth & Wolfe 2019). Alongside 
	these positive traits I also have some negative ones such as rarely feeling stressed, or anxious. These may seem 
	positive at a first glance, but it means I don’t stress when deadlines are close or experience the healthy levels of 
	anxiety that help us grow and learn from our mistakes (Koerth & Wolfe 2019). My lower levels of Extraversion also mean 
	that I don’t have a high interest in socialising, lower energy levels and a reduced ability to feel excited about other 
	people or society at large (Koerth & Wolfe 2019). </p>
	<br>

	<p> Based on the results reviewed from the three tests, I feel some interpretations of the tests were correct and others 
	brought the validity into question. Regarding what I felt was accurate, the Myers-Briggs test was overall the closest to 
	how I picture myself, especially the thinking trait, I consistently favour logic over emotion in most situations. I also 
	feel I am considerably more introverted than extroverted but have never had problems relating to others nor have I ever 
	had problems making or fostering relationships with others. The Learning style test I feel was incredibly accurate as I 
	can easily remember things I have seen, or had the ability to get hands-on practice with, whereas when I hear conversations 
	I struggle to remember exactly what had been said. </p>
	<br>

	<p> The results indicate that as a team member, I could be an asset as my tendencies to be creative yet assertive and 
	innovative could provide important insights to projects and discussions. I also feel that my learning style will not be 
	a hindrance on the group as correspondence will be mainly through discussion boards and most of the learning will be 
	through activities, reading, and lectures/tutorials which will have visual cues. Regarding my personality type affecting 
	the team, I feel the positives will outweigh the negatives as my organisational skills, attention to detail, and strong 
	sense of commitment to the team will help me produce the desired results (Koerth & Wolfe 2019). The connotation that 
	Architects may appear as cold towards others (16Personalities 2021), is imperative to be mindful of when forming and 
	working in a team and something that I should be aware of and ensure that other members do not create negative impressions. 
	I will also need to be aware that when unexpected events or problems occur, I may handle it differently to others. 
	I will need to take a step back and use empathy to understand other group members feelings towards an issue, especially 
	regarding deadlines and my drive to want to finish projects as accurately and quickly as possible.
